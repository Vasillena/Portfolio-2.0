## ⭐️  Introduction

Welcome to the backstage of my visual identity. This portfolio isn’t just a website. It’s an attempt to merge my two sides, a space where the cold, logical world of code collides with the expressive, unpredictable chaos of design.⁣
   <br/>
This project is built with Next.js, Tailwind, GSAP and Three.js.
